        <pre>Pacific Rim is a 2013 American monster action film directed by Guillermo del Toro
The first film in the Pacific Rim franchise, it stars Charlie Hunnam, Idris Elba, Rinko Kikuchi, Charlie Day, Robert Kazinsky, Max Martini, and Ron Perlman. 
The screenplay was written by Travis Beacham and del Toro from a story by Beacham. The film is set in the future, when Earth is at war with the Kaiju, 
colossal sea monsters which have emerged from an interdimensional portal on the bottom of the Pacific Ocean. 
To combat the monsters, humanity unites to create the Jaegers, gigantic humanoid mechas, each controlled by two co-pilots whose minds are joined by a mental link.</pre>
        <p>In 2020, brothers Yancy and Raleigh Becket pilot Jaeger Gipsy Danger to defend Anchorage from a Category-3 Kaiju codenamed Knifehead. 
            The Kaiju severely damages Gipsy, leading to Yancy's death. Raleigh kills Knifehead and pilots Gipsy to shore alone before collapsing. 
            Traumatized by his brother's loss and the stress of solo-piloting the Jaeger, he quits the program.</p>
        <p>All Jaegers except Gipsy Danger intervene. Otachi destroys Crimson Typhoon while Leatherback annihilates Cherno Alpha and disables Striker Eureka with an EMP blast, injuring Herc. 
            The nuclear-powered Gipsy, with Mako reinstated, eliminates both Kaiju before Newton is harmed. Meanwhile, Newton and Hannibal attempt to harvest Otachi's secondary brain but find she is pregnant; the infant Kaiju bursts out, devouring Hannibal before strangling itself with its umbilical cord. 
            Newton and Hermann drift with the infant's brain, discovering that the Breach only opens if it detects Kaiju DNA
